Conclusion:
Various locks/unlocks are the bottle neck in "Validated block" (TxValidator.Validate).
The go verfiy occupies only approximately 11% (149.70/1351.08).

Fabric:
respository: fabric
branch: stdnoduptxidcheck_pprof
commit: d7aae6bf68ed11327864a3417b64c0b2c7107092

Based on the PURE Fabric code, the following modifications were made:

1. Remove the check of duplicated TxId. 
We did this because the sdk client had already been modified to send multiple exactly the same endorsed, signed txs in one go (sdk.client.exec() )
commit: 81069d6dac463b935ff2c4d8e30c9e593dcb355c

2. Triggered txvalidator.Valid 100 times in coordinator.StoreBlock for pprof. 1 time txvalidator.Valid is too short for pprof to profile.

Payment Demo:
respository: demo
branch: benchmark
commit: 5547ef893752a2d0da4cf4630d27f571c6595ff2

1. The sdk was changed to send 5000 signed, endorsed txs in one go (client.Execute)
commit: 22fad4ef5a1f862cd500dab444e91b7c652843c4

2. The client side now only executs
    // payment-client.go [108-109] 
    client, _ := New(sdk)   
	client.CreateAccount(1, "100") // this will sends the same signed, endorsed txs 5000 times in one go.
