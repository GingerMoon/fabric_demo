The performance bottle neck found in "report - std fabric performance bottle neck pprofv1.3 20190123.log" was Lock & RLock. 
This is because from Fabric 1.3, key level policy was introduced and for every tx in the block, fabric vscc will lock&unlock the state for (dependency & WriteSet-Metadata).
After changed to v1.2, the ecdsa verify becomes the performance bottle neck as expected.

The verify work occupies:
259.72/466.58 = 55.66% -- from pprof svg
The TPS of commiting peer:
5000*1000/(1578+688) = 2206 -- from peer logs "Commit block" & "Validated block"

After the acceleration via FPGA (X10, only take vscc into account, I am still investigating on other bottle neck),
The verify work occupies:
25.972/466.58 = 5.566% -- from pprof svg
The TPS of commiting peer:
5000*1000/(157.8+688) = 5911 -- from peer logs "Commit block" & "Validated block"

NOTE: The data is from pprof test. Without the pprfo, the TPS should be higher. 

The test steps are mostly the same as the ones mentioned in "report - std fabric performance bottle neck pprofv1 20190123.log".
The only difference is, ApplicationCapabilities was changed from 1_3 to v1_2.
